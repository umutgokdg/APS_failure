# APS_failure
Scania a Swedish manufacturing company builds trucks for mining, construction, and some other heavy-related work. Due to heavy workload, most of the work is done by APS (Air Pressure System). APS generates the pressurized air that utilizes various functions in the truck such as braking and gear changes during operational work. However, a Scania Truck may fail due to the APS-related failure or any other failure.

The preoperational check of Scania trucks costs around $10 but if the truck fails during operation, this cost may go up to $500. So, the company wanted to build a system that tries to detect the failure before it happens so they can reduce the failure cost.
